# CSS

- Could explain the [**CSS anatomy**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Syntax).
- [**What places**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/How_CSS_works#How_to_apply_your_CSS_to_your_HTML) we can put the CSS codes, and which one we should use generally?
- Become familiar with the common CSS attributes, based on [**W3Schools CSS Tutorial**](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp).
- Understand all [**CSS values and units**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Values_and_units).
- Master all kinds of [**CSS selectors**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#Selectors) by heart.
- Understand the meaning of the [**Specificity**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Cascade_and_inheritance).
- could explain the [**CSS box modeling**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Box_model).
- CSS layouting. [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout)

> If you are a newbie to the CSS, you need 2 weeks maximum to grasp these concepts. However, if you are more or less familiar with CSS, you can become a master to these in a week.

## Less
After the above steps, you should research to understand what Less is and why we use that?
For learning how to use Less, read and practice from its [**official website**](http://lesscss.org/#overview)

> Average required time to learn Less is about one week.

## Sass
Besides the Less, you should master the **SASS**. So, you can start learning this by the [W3schools SASS tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sass/default.asp). For more details, I strongly recommend reading through the [SASS official documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)
> Average required time to learn the SASS thoroughly and read all the resources that I mentioned above is around two weeks.
